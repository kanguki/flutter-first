# Intro

I want to build some mobile apps

so I tried flutter :D

# Footsteps so far

Skim **[this](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/dart/)** real quick to at least get a feel about dart

Found **[this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU3wk7CDw4RfV3mEwOJbjx1k)**, watch some intros and explanation videos, follow part 1 **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6KZ3cTGBWw&list=PLjxrf2q8roU3wk7CDw4RfV3mEwOJbjx1k&index=3)** and part 2 **[here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0)**

Install flutter and android studio, set up android emulator

Browse github for some more complex flutter repos to get a feel of how real projects look like. I found FlutterScreens. After reading a few files, I feel that there's a concept of components (like html components) in flutter. I found **[this](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs/layout-basics)** and **[this](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material)**, watched **[this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXKp9RCWhZOMX1QHnSgPE1FYzX_6_O2_c)**

I kinda get what components in flutter are now. I find **[how to integrate apis](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data)**.
